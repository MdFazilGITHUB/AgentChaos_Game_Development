                <span class="red large">The Butcher </span>escaped from prison yesterday, and he's back <span class="red">again</span> on a killing spree. He has already brutally murdered <span class="red">4</span> people in just <span class="red">5</span> hours, and it doesn't seem like he will stop anytime soon. We have investigated the murder scene and he has left some random pieces of paper with some gibberish written. I think you need to take a look at these.
                <br><br>
                I know you were the one who threw him in prison last time, but I will suggest you this time that you <span class="red">kill him</span>, we no longer need to show him <span class="red font">MERCY</span>.
